Reproducible research
=====================

Have you ever spent days trying to repeat the results that took you
hours to do the first time last week?  Or you have to do paper
revisions, but you just can't get the results to match up?  Nothing is
a worse feeling - either for you or for science itself.

In this lesson we will discuss different methods and tools for better
reproducibility in research software and data. We will demonstrate how
version control, workflows, containers, and package managers can be
used to record reproducible environments and computational steps.

.. prereq::

   1. You need to install
      `Git, Python, and Snakemake <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/>`__.

   2. `Docker <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/docker/>`__
      and `make <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/make/>`__
      are optional (these are usually done as demos with no exercises).
